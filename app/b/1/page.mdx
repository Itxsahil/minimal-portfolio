It’s been a long time since I’ve written something — and honestly, I’m not even sure why I stopped. Maybe it’s because life has become so **hectic** and **draining** lately. Every day starts early, filled with the usual routines: rushing to work, returning home **exhausted**, handling all the small things that keep life moving. And yet, when I finally lie down at night, I still open my laptop — trying to **learn something new**, something that keeps me feeling **alive** even when I desperately want to sleep early.  
It’s **frustrating** and **restless**, but I can’t stop.

Somewhere along the way, I lost my **rhythm** — not just in writing, but in **reading** too. For years, I’ve been caught up chasing the next thing: a **good internship**, a **decent job**, the **latest tech trend**. I kept consuming new information but never gave myself time to reflect or create.

And maybe **AI tools like ChatGPT** have played a part too. Whenever I want to post something, I end up asking GPT to **refine my words**. Since **English isn’t my first language**, I often hesitate to share what I write in my **raw voice**. Over time, I’ve grown dependent on AI to sound better — and that slowly made me **stop writing altogether**.

But it’s almost the **end of the year**, and I want to change that. From now on, I’ll try to get back my **reading habit**. I’ll finish at least **two books** this year and **write something every weekend** — no matter how imperfect it sounds.

If you have any **book suggestions** that could help me **reconnect** with this side of myself, I’d love to hear them.

I hope you have a **great year**!
